# Coding Challenge --- Bank Transaction

Simple bank transaction coding challenge I completed while going through META's Backend Developer Certification.

Uses Abstract Classes and methods:
  1: Shows Bank Information (Current Balance, etc)
  2: Users can initiate a withdrawl()
  3: Checks if the amount of withdraw request is more than the balance. 
  4: If amount is less than balance, the account balance is updated -> and new balance returned.
