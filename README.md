# Coding Challenge --- Bank Transaction

Simple bank transaction coding challenge I completed while going through META's Backend Developer Certification.

Uses Abstract Classes and methods:
<ol>
  <li>Shows Bank Information (Current Balance, etc)</li>
  <li>Users can initiate a withdrawl()</li>
  <li>Checks if the amount of withdraw request is more than the balance.</li>
  <li>If amount is less than balance, the account balance is updated -> and new balance returned.</li>
</ol>
